Riley's portfolio website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and patience.

## FYI
This website will be going through major changes over its lifecycle. It was initially built in a short amount of time to get it off the ground and was never meant to be "perfect", just functional. **As I learn and grow as a developer and designer, this website will change to reflect that.** Consider this the base to be built upon!

## Contributing
Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests for errors or typos! Below you can find an ongoing list of things I am working on that will eventually be folded into this site's development. If you have insight or expertise on one of those subjects, please reach out or contribute!

- "Dark Mode"
- CSS library usage (will start a new repo to work on making our own)
- General code improvements
